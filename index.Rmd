# what is sage bionetworks?

A non-profit research institute working to make science more **open**, **collaborative**, and **inclusive**. 

```{r sage, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sage-logo.svg")
```

???
A lot of scientific work tends to be very closed, people don't want to share their data etc.

I joined Sage in part because of the focus on open science

My colleagues are computational biologists, software engineers, designers

# my team at sage

Data Coordinating Center for communities researching neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases

???

We get grants from funding agencies to help other scientists share their data

# AMP-AD 
### Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer’s Disease

- Identifying potential drug targets for Alzheimer’s disease
- We curate and share data from AMP-AD and related groups

???

- omics data, behavioral, lots of different types, some quite large (especially omics data) — many consist of hundreds or thousands of files that can be multiple gigabytes each

# my work at sage

Helping researchers document and share their data

--

Developing standards for metadata to enable cross-project collaboration and sharing

--

Data cleaning and validation

???

you've read the paper I wrote with Karl Broman about how to organize data in spreadsheets. Most of my collaborators have not read this paper, and their data is often messy and lacking important information.

But, they are required to share data by the NIH policies

In addition to helping them do this, we're developing more standardized data formats so that it's easier to reuse data from many different projects

I also clean and validate data that researchers submit. This can be very time consuming and involves writing a lot of custom R scripts to clean up the data and publish it to our data platform.

A little about the baikal project and data
3 generations of a single family of Siberian scientists collected data starting in the 1940s
I cleaned this data and prepped it for analyses, helped guide researchers on data best practices, etc.

Started getting more involved in the R community on Twitter and experimenting with things on my own, which sometimes led to unexpected results

- Intern on ggplot2

???

- I enjoyed working with data and decided to go back for my MLIS
- Took classes in data curation, data science, data visualization
- From having been involved with the R community, after I graduated I got offered an internship working on ggplot2 with Hadley Wickham
- Fixed bugs, added some new features to ggplot2

I know how to write shiny apps to do data validation because I first wrote one to track my car's gas mileage

# ggbarf

```{r ggbarf, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
library("ggbarf")
set.seed(123)
dat <- data.frame(x = sample(letters[1:3], 6, replace = TRUE))

ggplot(dat, aes(x)) +
  geom_barf()
```

![:url black](https://github.com/karawoo/ggbarf)

I wrote this because I accidentally typed geom_barf() instead of geom_bar() once
